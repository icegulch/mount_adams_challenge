Adams challenge today, June 4, 2016. What a nice day… summits in the clear and views far into Maine and even Vermont. My time was 1:35:24; I included a picture from either side of the summit sign just in case! It was a real leg and lung buster but I especially enjoyed how the route showcased a little bit of everything that the Whites have to offer.</p> <p>I left RMC’s trail crew and caretaker housing, Stearns Lodge, where I live with the rest of the Randolph Mountain Club trail crew, and jogged to the Appalachia trailhead in a thick heat in just a pair of shorts and my vest; I was eager to gain a few K’s if only to find drier air. Going into the challenge, I thought I might be able to get around two hours. Imagine my surprise when I got to Thunderstorm Junction at around 1:30! I was tickled to say the least. Though I was pushing myself just below redlining for the whole time, I found most of the route to be runable (particularly on Gulfside, where the stones were stacked flat to form a smooth path through the jumble, and the grade was perfect for cruising smoothly uphill). </p> <p>I appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into selecting the route; it does a good job of putting you on trails both smooth and rugged, steep and not quite so steep, and both well traveled and faint. At the top I was rewarded with three things; a time of 1:35:24 (yay!), clear views well into Maine and Vermont, and a keen breeze that to my sweaty, near-naked self was colder&#39;n a witches teat in winter. It was a fun time!</p> <p>Thanks again for a fun challenge!</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer id=sponsors role=contentinfo> <div class=container> <div class=row> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://whitemountaincafe.com/testpresscafe/" target=_blank><img src="../../images/wmc.svg" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://www.libbysbistro.org/#!saalt-pub/cjg9" target=_blank><img src="../../images/saalt.png" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> </div> <aside class=special-thanks> Photos made by <a href="http://klementovichphoto.com/" target=_blank>Klementovich Photo</a>.<br> Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@whitemountaincafe.com">info@whitemountaincafe.com</a>. </aside> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
