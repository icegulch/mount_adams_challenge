Congrats, Dave! Here’s his story:</p> <p>I had been intrigued with the Challenge since last fall. It looked like something doable even for a 63-year-old with less than springy knees who spent most of the last 17 years in the decidedly flatter territory of Wisconsin and Washington, DC.</p> <p>I was watching the forecast for about a week, and it looked like Wednesday the 24th was going to be clear, so that was to be the day. I was up with the birds in Limerick, Maine, and after a quick stop at McDonald’s in North Conway for a large coffee, I made it to Appalachia by shortly after 6. </p> <p>The Valley Way to Brookside was surprisingly runable (and dry!), but the stream crossings on Brookside did slow me down a bit, and it was more hiking than running after that. Watson to Scar was relatively quick with a bit more running, but I only found a few short stretches on Scar where I could break into a trot. </p> <p>I hit Airline at 1:10 and was feeling pretty comfortable about making the goal, but shortly the climbing on Airline began to take a toll on my quads and calves. And the wind was pretty strong as well, so I had to stop for a few minutes to add some layers, including wind shirt, gloves and a knit hat - wished I had tights on. By the time I hit Gulfside I was in and out of the clouds and cold. It was fun to run on the what I think of as the Inca Highway (all those fitted stones) but the rougher area approaching Thunderstorm really took its toll on me, especially without the psychological lift of being able to see the summit. </p> <p>Turning left at Thunderstorm Junction, the rocks were very slippery from the fog and I really had to pick and feel my way to the top. I had not been there in over 25 years, so was a bit nonplussed to get to what to me was obviously the top but no sign saying “Mt Adams” for the finish photo. Guess I should have read the blog first! Didn’t see a soul all the way up– though I did see wet bootprints on Brookside and Watson and wondered if I was trailing another “challenger.” </p> <p>I didn’t hang around on top even though the clouds were blowing off - my fingers were blocks of ice thanks to Reynauds Syndrome .Taking photos with a cell phone camera was a challenge. Very happy to clamber down to Madison Spring and get some hot coffee! Thanks, AMC, for that! And thanks to those who took the time to set up the Challenge. Going down the Valley Way was as much of a challenge as the trip up given the mud and tired knees! Now I know why the route up was the the drier and more convoluted one. So now I’m looking for a new goal - any suggestions?</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer id=sponsors role=contentinfo> <div class=container> <div class=row> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://whitemountaincafe.com/testpresscafe/" target=_blank><img src="../../images/wmc.svg" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://www.libbysbistro.org/#!saalt-pub/cjg9" target=_blank><img src="../../images/saalt.png" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> </div> <aside class=special-thanks> Photos made by <a href="http://klementovichphoto.com/" target=_blank>Klementovich Photo</a>.<br> Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@whitemountaincafe.com">info@whitemountaincafe.com</a>. </aside> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
