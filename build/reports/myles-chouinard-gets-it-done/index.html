I knew that it would not be easy to get under 2 hours and 10 minutes and I would have to push my limits. I love these kind of challenges, you versus yourself. It’s a mental game and that is what drew me to this challenge. </p> <p>I got out of work early and decided to give it a go. I have summited Mount Adams many times before but never by the trails the MAC requires. I knew from previous hikes and runs that I would be pushing the 2:10 time limit to summit Adams. I would have to give it everything I had and then some. </p> <p>I started off on the Valley Way with a light jog and once I got to Brookside that turned into a fast walk. Most of this hike I could not run, but rather just walk as fast as possible with some running done on the flat sections. Once I got to the Airline I knew I would be definitely be pushing 2:10 and I needed to step up my pace. I started pushing harder than I ever had before and was almost out of gas by the time I got to Lowe’s Path for the last 0.2 miles. </p> <p>I looked at my watch to see I had less than ten minutes till I would reach the time limit and started to question if I could make it or not. Rather than slowing on the grueling 29% grade of the Lowe’s Path, I dug deep within myself and pushed even harder making it to the summit with less than 2 minutes to spare! </p> <p>Myles Chouinard</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer id=sponsors role=contentinfo> <div class=container> <div class=row> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://whitemountaincafe.com/testpresscafe/" target=_blank><img src="../../images/wmc.svg" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://www.libbysbistro.org/#!saalt-pub/cjg9" target=_blank><img src="../../images/saalt.png" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> </div> <aside class=special-thanks> Photos made by <a href="http://klementovichphoto.com/" target=_blank>Klementovich Photo</a>.<br> Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@whitemountaincafe.com">info@whitemountaincafe.com</a>. </aside> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
