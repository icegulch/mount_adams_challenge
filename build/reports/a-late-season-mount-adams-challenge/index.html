Valley Way was a good warm up, with its generally gentle incline. The trail was coated with a thick layer of leaves, and footing required some thought and care. Brookside had a nice blend of rolling terrain that was runnable, combined with steeper pitches that gained elevation quickly. Watson was a little tricky to see the entrance path, but made for some nice running after just gaining a lot of elevation. Scar had some nice sections to open up the stride and I was pretty comfortable with the pace when I reached Airline in under an hour. </p> <p>Airline became a little more challenging above treeline, and for some reason I took a wrong turn where the trail sign was on the ground. After reaching Madison hut, I panicked a little, but still felt time was okay to double back and still make it. Gulfside became a fun rock hopping half mile, before taking care to make the correct turn at Lowe’s Path and make the final push to make it in under my goal time of 2 hours at 1:59:40. </p> <p>I was glad to have persevered after making a mistake. I sat and admired the awesome view for a few minutes before taking Air Line on the return. Thanks for a fun and unique way to tackle this mountain!</p> <p>Jeremy Ward</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer id=sponsors role=contentinfo> <div class=container> <div class=row> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://whitemountaincafe.com/testpresscafe/" target=_blank><img src="../../images/wmc.svg" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> <figure class="col-6 col-sm-3"> <a href="http://www.libbysbistro.org/#!saalt-pub/cjg9" target=_blank><img src="../../images/saalt.png" class=img-fluid alt=""/></a> </figure> </div> <aside class=special-thanks> Photos made by <a href="http://klementovichphoto.com/" target=_blank>Klementovich Photo</a>.<br> Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@whitemountaincafe.com">info@whitemountaincafe.com</a>. </aside> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
