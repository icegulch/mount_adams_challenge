That’s about all it takes to motivate me to endure 120 minutes of pain. I finally made time to drive to New Hampshire and attempt the 2:10 barrier. Laura Brockett and her husband Pete also started the Challenge at the same time early on Saturday, August 29th. </p> <p>I was most worried about getting lost and missing a turn as the directions are pretty confusing. My concerns were warranted as I got lost on both the first and second junctions! Just for about a minute each as I knew right away something was not right! The hardest past was Brookside’s steeps and tough footing. The most enjoyable parts were Scar’s pine carpet and Gulfside’s rocky road. From Thunderstorm Junction to the top is bouldering at best and as it was howling and foggy, and it made for some very sketchy footing. </p> <p>I got to the top in 1:43:35 and quickly huddled with a fellow hiker in a crag to get out of the wind. I then ran down to assist and motivate Laura and Pete as they tried to break the 2:10 barrier as well. I met them at Thunderstorm junction and hiked up with them as they just squeaked in at 2:07 and 2:08!!!
