# # Back in 2014, I ran the Mount Adams Challenge in its first year after a suggestion from a friend. It sounded like a great time! I managed to hack my way to a successful time with about three minutes to spare that year. I managed just under 2 hours in 2015 and 2016 but my time this year was back above at 2:04:22.

# # I felt good this year though. Running the Valley Way and Brookside with short steps and a steady pace got me into the distance a bit. The last part of Brookside is rough. I knew I'd be power hiking there so I ran when I could early. The Watson and Scar went by with no confusion although I'm convinced there are an extra 0.2 miles hidden in this part. The Scar Trail is a gem and fun to run. The Airline section is another power hiking section for me due to the steepness and rough footing, but I was on good pace so somewhere in this mile I decided pulling in under 2:10 was a good goal and relaxed a bit. 

# # I did not really have it in me to push for my PR even though I'm sure I did the first two miles faster and steadier than before.  I enjoyed a slow jog along Gulfside after redirecting a slightly confused hiker toward the hut. Reaching Thunderstorm Junction, I picked my way over the jumbled boulders to the summit and enjoyed a few moments of gratitude, rest, and spectacular views on a perfect summer summit day before heading down the Airline. After four years of the MAC, I think it's becoming habit!"

# After an unfortunate attempt at the Mount Adams Challenge last fall (I convinced myself I missed the Watson Path turn and headed back down Brookside ½ a mile only to realize I must not have reached it yet), on Tuesday, September 27th I got the chance to give another try. I am caretaking AMC’s Tuckerman Ravine Hermit Lake Shelter this fall, and the morning rain kept me working on inside chores and reading _All the Pretty Horses_. At 1:00 pm, I stepped out of the cabin, facing a beautiful day and warm enough conditions that the rocky summits would be dry. My mid-day start limited what run I could go on, and the thought of finishing the Carter-Moriah or Presidential traverse at sun-down with no way of getting a ride back to Pinkham Notch didn’t sound ideal. I jogged down the Tuckerman’s Ravine trail, hopped in my death wagon and drove to the Route 2 Appalachia trailhead.

# I got a start at 2:30 pm with a small pack containing some water, warm layers, Fig Newtons, and apricots for the descent. The first mile on Valley Way hit me like a wave of déjà vu, quick turnover with fairly easy dirt footing. Under the forest’s canopy, the morning rain stuck on slippery rocks and heightened my perception with a fear of injury.  Brookside up until the turn for Watson kept me very on edge. I started getting stressed about injury as I repeatedly lost my footing on roots, moss, rock, and mud. What an ass-kicking running on that trail is! Turinng onto Watson Path and crossing onto Scar Trail gave me a chance to catch my breath and refocus on short steps and quick turnover.

# Since working at AMC’s Madison Spring Hut in the summer of 2014, the Scar Trail has been my favorite trail in the White Mountains. It gets little use, it meanders in just a way that you feel like a rally car on a windy dirt road while running on it, and the moss and ferns redefine green. I knew that little running would be had on Airline, so I pushed it through the end of Scar Trail and once I popped out on the knife edge of Airline, I pressed my hands through my knees, powering my body up the steep steps as I looked down the thousand feet into King’s Ravine.

# I turned onto Gulfside under 1 hour and 8 minutes and thought that my goal of going under 1:20 was out of reach. Moving quickly over the green lichen rocks, I passed by two very late North-bound Appalachian Trail thru-hikers who gave me smiles and encouraging remarks. The turn at Thunderstorm Junction and the absence of the flat rocks of the Gulfside Trail took me by surprise once again as I sought out grassy patches and the flattest rocks I could. Lowe’s Path is curiously more of a route to the summit of Adams than it is a trail. The final hard push up to the summit sign was accompanied by the endorphins of being back atop the Presidential range on a glorious fall day. I stopped my watch with my hand on the summit sign, 1:20:37. What a beautiful route to a beautiful summit, looking down on Starr Lake and JQ Adams, with Madison and the Mahoosucs in the distance. Time for some Fig Newtons! I hope to get another burn on the M.A.C. this year in drier conditions, and bring the FKT under 80 minutes.

# Congrats to Brent Trail, for the fastest new time on the M.A.C. Though the Challenge is just for fun for the trail running community, it is interesting to note the new records that come along. Brent ran the route on September 9th. Here’s what he wrote about the experience. 

# Unfortunately, I didn’t take a photo at the top because there were a ton of people at the summit eating lunch but I do have my GPS maps from the run. My time was 1:24:33 and I used the MapMyRun app on my phone: 

# <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/1737082829">http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/1737082829</a>

# It was a fantastic run, even though the summit was fogged in from Thunderstorm Junction. It was my 3rd attempt at the run. The first 2 times I got turned around on the Watson path and scar trail junctions but the 3rd time was a charm. Hopefully, I can try one more time before the first snow fall when I get back from running the Spartan race world championships in Lake Tahoe in just over 2 weeks.

# On a trip back to New England from the my life as a transplant in the Sierra Nevada of California, I had my first attempt at the Mount Adams Challenge planned from the get go. The many paths of the Randolph Mountain Club have always been a special place for me, from my time spent hiking there each summer as well as a season on the RMC Trail Crew. Once a window from the rain opened up for a few hours I decided to give it a go hoping the rain wouldn't turn me back. 

# Coming from the evenly graded trails in the west, the first mile went great, but as things got steep I was quickly reminded of how truly rough the Presidentials are. I tried push the pace on the flatter sections and give an even effort on the steep hiking. I paid my penance for being gone for so long with a slight detour at the beginning of the Brookside trail, but got back on track after a couple minutes. As I popped above treelike a little after an hour from the start, I was getting a bit low on energy. Luckily the high elevation blueberries were in full swing so I ate a few along the Airline knife-edge. Powered by blueberries and a really good view of King Ravine, the Gulfside Trail and the final summit push felt great. 

# At the top the summits of Madison and Washington were in and out of the clouds. Although the view from the top was a bit shrouded, I was just happy to be back on top of the mountains I love so much. On the way down I took the scenic route of the Lowe's Path to the Quay and stopped to drink out of the spring between Crag Camp and Greyknob. An icy dip in the Ravine House pool did just the trick to cap off a great run in the mountains.

# Two weeks ago, I was lucky enough to serve as the Crag Camp fill-in caretaker. After two seasons on the Randolph Mountain Club’s summer trail crew and two springs spent as the Gray Knob Caretaker, I was looking forward to exploring the trails in their summer glory (without a 70 lb pack!) and chatting it up with the colorful summer guests at the camps.

# I had just completed a long summer backpacking trip and was nowhere near as beat up as I was after a summer spent on trail crew, so I decided it would be prime time to try out the ‘Mount Adams Challenge’. I chatted with Doug Mayer about his idea when he was first cooking it up during my first summer (2014) on trail crew. We did a Prezi traverse together, winding through some of those little used RMC paths on our way up. I loved the idea of stringing together these trails in order to make the typically relentless Whites style trails a bit more gradual and runnable, but was never able to get to it during my trail crew years. Fortunately for me and the RMC camps, caretaker Carl had everything dialed and my duties consisted of talking to guests, collecting their fees and exploring the immediate area.

# I packed an empty propane bomb down from the camps early Tuesday morning, then met RMC Field Supervisor Cheryl for a bit in the valley. I got to the Valley Way trailhead at just about noon, took a photo at the base and then headed up. I’ve never hiked this section of the Valley Way before, as the Camps and Madison Hut Croo take some RMC shortcuts to minimize the amount of day hikers they see for their first mile or so. I was surprised to discover it is a rather pleasant section, following some water features and is runnable up until the turn onto Brookside. I was reduced to power hiking on short sections of Brookside and was already trying to minimize the times I checked my watch so I wouldn’t realize that I surely had more than an hour of suffering ahead of me! I finally reached the Watson junction and enjoyed the brief downhill before worrying I was lost, but was happy to cross the Valley Way and head up Scar. I love this mossy section of trail. This was the last bit I truly enjoyed before being reduced to a crawl on steep sections of Air Line. The view of the Ravine was spectacular as always and I turned on to Gulfsides’ pavement (thanks Edmands!) at 1:15. I was really hoping to break 1:30 and reached Thunderstorm Junction with 6 minutes to spare. I scrambled through the relentless rockpiles of ankle breakers and baby heads to reach the summit just under my goal! It was a beautiful day up top and I enjoyed a Snickers and some water before marching back down the Camps. Thanks for the inspiration!

# Beautiful day out there today – sunny and clear, no bugs, dry rocks, low humidity. My only major navigational mishap was early on in the game after turning onto the Brookside Trail. I continued down the trail and soon found myself staring befuddled at a fork in the path with a sign for Edmands Col and no more evident signage for Brookside... I picked the incorrect fork and somehow wound up back on Valley Way. Nnnnoooooo! I semi-panicked, backtracked to the beginning of Brookside, spent some time looking at the map, and ultimately managed to correct my mistake (though I wasn’t confident about it at the time). Only lost ~5.5 minutes with all of this, but it felt like an eternity as I anxiously consulted the map and made some educated guesses. I pouted and cursed my poor navigational skills, feeling spooked for the next stretch until I successfully hooked the right onto Watson Path. A pair of hikers had paused for a break directly at the trailhead, but I probably would have scooted directly by them and the turn if I hadn’t paused for a quick chat and map check. I managed to stay on the right track from Watson-to-Scar (taking care not to hang a wrong turn onto Valley Way again...), and loved my time on the Scar trail segment as I felt some of my earlier route-induced stress recede. 

# I was happy to make it onto the Airline Trail since I’m familiar with that and the summit trails. Running vs. hiking-wise, I found that Valley Way was joggable, but settled into an aggressive power march most of the hike thereafter. Been working hard to shake a nagging high hamstring injury, and going all out with the uphill running just isn’t worth the risk... there is so much agility, fearlessness, focus, and practice involved in moving quickly over this type of terrain (as opposed to simply running on road or soft trail), and I have a long way to go before I reach mountain goat status. 

# Once I passed the bad weather sign to emerge above treeline, I felt reasonably confident I’d be able to make the 2:10 mark if I didn’t lollygag. I moved really well across Gulfside and felt great cranking up Lowe’s Path to the summit. Plenty of other hikers at this point and loads of happy people at the top! I was a little bummed when I realized I had just missed the 2:00 barrier, but hey, next time. Mostly, I was thankful to feel healthy and capable the whole hike (aside from a bit of mental sniveling after my Brookside fumble).

# I took my sweet time on the way down, wandering over to Madison Hut for a water refill and a delicious $1 slice of bread. Ambled down to Appalachia via Valley Way and hit the parking lot by 12:30. The Tin Mountain Century Ride bike race was well underway at this point, and I had fun cheering on some cyclists before hitting the road myself.

# I finally made the trip north for the MAC this morning. This was supposed to be a casual recon trip for a more serious attempt in August, but at some point I realized I could finish in under two hours, so I picked up the pace a little. 

# It’s a geat route. I hadn’t been on that section of Scar Trail before, or Gulfside, for that matter. The Watson Path junction with Valley Way had a large group sitting all around the sign post and on the Watson Path. I went down far enough to realize my mistake, but not terribly far.

# I had forgotten just how crazy the parking situation is at Appalachia. Holy smokes! I arrived at 7:00 and found cars already 100 yards down the road.

# David Sandham (the Brit) and David Loutzenheiser decided that running in the Mt Washington Road Race on Saturday was not enough and decided to do the Mt Adams Challenge on Sunday June 19!  The weather was perfect, well a little warm, but little wind, and few bugs.  So off we went!  

# We missed the turnoff to Watson path, not realizing it until unexpectedly running into a co-worker at the next trail junction.  We paused, redirected, and back to the turnoff and up we went to the top.  Finished in 1:54.  We continued on to Mt Jefferson (at a fast hiking pace) and then back down via Crag Camp.

# Thanks for inspiring us to try this new challenge!  I am sure we will both be back to try to beat our times.

# #     I did the Mt. Adams challenge today, June 4, 2016. What a nice day... summits in the clear and views far into Maine and even Vermont. My time was 1:35:24; I included a picture from either side of the summit sign just in case! It was a real leg and lung buster but I especially enjoyed how the route showcased a little bit of everything that the Whites have to offer.

# #     I left RMC’s trail crew and caretaker housing, Stearns Lodge, where I live with the rest of the Randolph Mountain Club trail crew, and jogged to the Appalachia trailhead in a thick heat in just a pair of shorts and my vest; I was eager to gain a few K’s if only to find drier air. Going into the challenge, I thought I might be able to get around two hours. Imagine my surprise when I got to Thunderstorm Junction at around 1:30! I was tickled to say the least. Though I was pushing myself just below redlining for the whole time, I found most of the route to be runable (particularly on Gulfside, where the stones were stacked flat to form a smooth path through the jumble, and the grade was perfect for cruising smoothly uphill). 

# #     I appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into selecting the route; it does a good job of putting you on trails both smooth and rugged, steep and not quite so steep, and both well traveled and faint. At the top I was rewarded with three things; a time of 1:35:24 (yay!), clear views well into Maine and Vermont, and a keen breeze that to my sweaty, near-naked self was colder'n a witches teat in winter. It was a fun time!

# #     Thanks again for a fun challenge!

# #     November 5, 2015

# #     It was unseasonably warm at the base and made for perfect weather to make a crack at this challenge. Valley Way was a good warm up, with its generally gentle incline. The trail was coated with a thick layer of leaves, and footing required some thought and care. Brookside had a nice blend of rolling terrain that was runnable, combined with steeper pitches that gained elevation quickly. Watson was a little tricky to see the entrance path, but made for some nice running after just gaining a lot of elevation. Scar had some nice sections to open up the stride and I was pretty comfortable with the pace when I reached Airline in under an hour. 

# #     Airline became a little more challenging above treeline, and for some reason I took a wrong turn where the trail sign was on the ground. After reaching Madison hut, I panicked a little, but still felt time was okay to double back and still make it. Gulfside became a fun rock hopping half mile, before taking care to make the correct turn at Lowe’s Path and make the final push to make it in under my goal time of 2 hours at 1:59:40. 

# #     I was glad to have persevered after making a mistake. I sat and admired the awesome view for a few minutes before taking Air Line on the return. Thanks for a fun and unique way to tackle this mountain!

# #     I woke up late at Moose Brook State Park— there was no rush, as the temperature was  perfect and it was not going to be hot... so no need to get up at 5 am. Curiously, there were not so many people at this nice campground— maybe the Canadian dollar value was not helping? 

# #     After a hearty breakfast, it was time to begin this challenge! I arrived at Appalachia Park— it was full, so I thought, “There must be a lot of people doing the challenge today!”

# #     I found a spot along Route 2, and put on my new Inov-8 trail rock shoes, and my new Ultraspire one-liter hydration pack, and tossed in a Clif Bar. At the bottom of the trail, I met a guy who said it took him three hours to come down from Madison Hut. I thought, “I’m doing the Mount Adams Challenge and my goal is 2 hours, 10 minutes. He just said, “Good luck!” 

# #     It was 11:00. My goal was two hours up, an hour or two down.. and then my IPA beer reward at <a href="http://www.libbysbistro.org">SAaLT Pub</a>.  

# #     On the run, I came to the first big intersection of Brookside. Luckily, some guys were there, because I was not sure where to go. One of the guys showed me the path and said, “Take it easy!” 

# #     I didn’t take any photos. I figured I’d do that on the way down! It was a narrow path and I needed to check where I put my feet. 

# #     I got to Watson Path, and ran downhill briefly. Why down?! I wasn’t sure. But, it wasn’t long, and then I was across Valley Way, along the poorly marked section to Scar Path. 

# #     Scar Path was a nice run. I just had a regular watch with no GPS. I thought, “Why not make it two hours instead of 2:10?” Scar was quiet, with just two people there. 

# #     Next up? Airline. Not much running on that section. And then... I came out of the woods and saw the whole thing, and thought, “Well, 2 hours and 10 minutes is okay!” 

# #     In fact, I was much less confident. There was a lot left, and it was climbing on rocks, so there was no running to be had. Fortunately, Gulfside had good rock placements. At the last section to the summit, there were more people, looking at me strangely: “Why is this guy in such a rush?!”


# #     The last section was better than I thought, though, and I got to the summit just before two hours. 

# #     There were just five people on the summit, including two other “frenchies,” so I asked them for a suggestion as to which way to go down. They suggested Airine, but I had already been that way, so I headed for Madison hut. On the descent, I remember how downhills can hurt your knees. I got to Madison Hut, and realized Madison summit will have to wait for the next trip! 

# #     It was slow going down, and I realized my IPA would have to wait. It was hard thinking of that beer... when I was out of water and moving slowly. I finally made it to the brook on the map, where it was less steep, and I started to run for my IPA. I stopped in a small brook to cool down, which was beautiful.

# #     At 4:10, I was at the car. I had a quick shower, and headed to SAaLT Pub. It was full, but a nice girl asked me if I wanted a beer while I was waiting. I got the beer, pasta, and a second beer... a perfect finish to a very nice day!

# #     It was great to have done this challenge. Thank you so much. It was very fun, and I hope there are more events like the Mount Adams Challenge.

# #     After learning about the Mount Adams Challenge from my sister Laura, I have been excited to try to add my name to the list and get a free coffee. That’s about all it takes to motivate me to endure 120 minutes of pain. I finally made time to drive to New Hampshire and attempt the 2:10 barrier. Laura Brockett and her husband Pete also started the Challenge at the same time early on Saturday, August 29th. 

# #     I was most worried about getting lost and missing a turn as the directions are pretty confusing. My concerns were warranted as I got lost on both the first and second junctions! Just for about a minute each as I knew right away something was not right! The hardest past was Brookside’s steeps and tough footing. The most enjoyable parts were Scar’s pine carpet and Gulfside’s rocky road. From Thunderstorm Junction to the top is bouldering at best and as it was howling and foggy, and it made for some very sketchy footing. 

# #     I got to the top in 1:43:35 and quickly huddled with a fellow hiker in a crag to get out of the wind. I then ran down to assist and motivate Laura and Pete as they tried to break the 2:10 barrier as well. I met them at Thunderstorm junction and hiked up with them as they just squeaked in at 2:07 and 2:08!!! Fun Challenge!

# #     When I first heard of the MAC I knew I had to give it a try. I knew that it would not be easy to get under 2 hours and 10 minutes and I would have to push my limits. I love these kind of challenges, you versus yourself. It's a mental game and that is what drew me to this challenge. 

# #     I got out of work early and decided to give it a go. I have summited Mount Adams many times before but never by the trails the MAC requires. I knew from previous hikes and runs that I would be pushing the 2:10 time limit to summit Adams. I would have to give it everything I had and then some. 

# #     I started off on the Valley Way with a light jog and once I got to Brookside that turned into a fast walk. Most of this hike I could not run, but rather just walk as fast as possible with some running done on the flat sections. Once I got to the Airline I knew I would be definitely be pushing 2:10 and I needed to step up my pace. I started pushing harder than I ever had before and was almost out of gas by the time I got to Lowe's Path for the last 0.2 miles. 

# #     I looked at my watch to see I had less than ten minutes till I would reach the time limit and started to question if I could make it or not. Rather than slowing on the grueling 29% grade of the Lowe's Path, I dug deep within myself and pushed even harder making it to the summit with less than 2 minutes to spare!

# #     Nice going, Mount Washington State Park Manager Mike Pelchat! Mike tackled the Mount Adams Challenge on June 27th and did it in style, completing it in 1:43:28. Writing about it on Facebook, Mike said, “The object is to run a set of trails to summit of Mt Adams in under 2hrs., 10min. Its mostly hiking as fast as one can. Fitbit time was off compared to MapMyRun on IPhone. Lots of people above tree line. It was a fun challenge!” Mike’s training? He had run the Mount Washington Road Race the weekend prior!

# #   post_body:

# #     And on June 24, Dave Kruschwitz from Limerick, Maine had a great day for the Mount Adams Challenge. Congrats, Dave! Here’s his story:

# #     I had been intrigued with the Challenge since last fall.  It looked like something doable even for a 63-year-old with less than springy knees who spent most of the last 17 years in the decidedly flatter territory of Wisconsin and Washington, DC.

# #     I was watching the forecast for about a week, and it looked like Wednesday the 24th was going to be clear, so that was to be the day.  I was up with the birds in Limerick, Maine, and after a quick stop at McDonald's in North Conway for a large coffee, I made it to Appalachia by shortly after 6.  

# #     The Valley Way to Brookside was surprisingly runable (and dry!), but the stream crossings on Brookside did slow me down a bit, and it was more hiking than running after that.  Watson to Scar was relatively quick with a bit more running, but I only found a few short stretches on Scar where I could break into a trot.   

# #     I hit Airline at 1:10 and was feeling pretty comfortable about making the goal, but shortly the climbing on Airline began to take a toll on my quads and calves.  And the wind was pretty strong as well, so I had to stop for a few minutes to add some layers, including wind shirt, gloves and a knit hat - wished I had tights on.  By the time I hit Gulfside I was in and out of the clouds and cold.  It was fun to run on the what I think of as the Inca Highway (all those fitted stones) but the rougher area approaching Thunderstorm really took its toll on me, especially without the psychological lift of being able to see the summit.  

# #     Turning left at Thunderstorm Junction, the rocks were very slippery from the fog and I really had to pick and feel my way to the top.  I had not been there in over 25 years, so was a bit nonplussed to get to what to me was obviously the top but no sign saying "Mt Adams" for the finish photo.  Guess I should have read the blog first!   Didn't see a soul all the way up-- though I did see wet bootprints on Brookside and Watson and wondered if I was trailing another "challenger.”   

# #     I didn't hang around on top even though the clouds were blowing off - my fingers were blocks of ice thanks to Reynauds Syndrome .Taking photos with a cell phone camera was a challenge.  Very happy to clamber down to Madison Spring and get some hot coffee!  Thanks, AMC, for that!  And thanks to those who took the time to set up the Challenge.  Going down the Valley Way was as much of a challenge as the trip up given the mud and tired knees! Now I know why the route up was the the drier and more convoluted one.   So now I'm looking for a new goal - any suggestions?

# #     On June 4th, three of us attempted the Mt Adams vertical challenge as part of a larger vertical training day: Andy Kernytsky, Kevin Marks, and myself, Jeff Hixon made the trek. Here’s our story:

# #     We set out on the prescribed routes at about 9 AM after a drive up from Boston.  It was a very nice day on the mountains after the morning fog and clouds lifted and we had a very pleasant trip up Adams.  We had several navigational ‘pauses’ due to our relative unfamiliarity with the route (It had been a few years since I’ve been over that way & first time for Kevin and Andy) but we did manage to make it in 2:02!  We did not push the pace, as we were continuing on for the rest of the day with a few more ascents, along with the nav pauses, but it will leave us with a time to beat for next time!

# #     Attached are our GPS logs and a few pics form the summit!

# #     Thanks for doing this, it was a great time and provided us a little extra motivation on our first ascent of the day!!

# #     Best,

# #     Jeff, on behalf of Kevin and Andy as well

# #     Finally back to home at the base of the Northern Presidentials, I decided to give the Mount Adams Challenge a go. It was time! It’s been a good summer for me... I’m in great trail running condition, after a season of trail running and leading trips. And, best of all, I’m light (well, for me, anyway), which really seems to help on the uphills-- almost as much as the jet pack. (Damn, my secret is out...)

# #     In the end, a summer of big hills paid off. 1:45:58. I bet that’ll be my fastest time for a while. My Suunto doesn’t pause on the screen with the results when you stop it, so I didn’t get a snapshot of the time... but <a href="http://www.movescount.com/moves/move42424251#.VDM4YmH7Bkw.email">here’s the log</a>!

# #     Fun moments: passing a few folks on the trail, and balancing my desire to be courtesy with my interest in cranking out a good time. (I'm not stopping... but I am saying hi!) And, of course, glancing up for a moment here and there when above treeline, to see the foliage in King Ravine from the Air Line, a view that will never get old for me. 

# #     It was a great afternoon: quiet on the trails, a beautiful view from the summit... and then a run down to beat sunset, arriving at Appalachia just as the forest was headed towards pitch black.

# #     All in all, a great afternoon. Now, on to that beer at SAALT and the cappuccino at the White Mountain Cafe!

# Editor’s note: Congratulations to Amy and Charlie Gunn, for giving the Mount Adams Challenge a try! Amy, we hope you’ll give it a go again. A beer and cappuccino await you!

# By Charlie and Amy Gunn

# **Amy:** Odd Bersvendsen had already successfully completed the Mount Adams Challenge and had invited my husband Charlie Gunn to join him on his quest to better his time. Charlie thought I should give it a try too.
#  
# On Friday, August 29, 2014, we arrived at the Appalachia parking lot sometime around 9:30 am. Instead of waiting for Odd and his wife Sally Brassil, I decided to go! This would be my third visit to Adams’ summit in recent months and hopefully after speedily getting to the summit I would continue my Randolph Mountain Club trail collecting. I wore my small pack with clothes, headlamp/first aid kit, hiking poles and two liters of water. I am sure I set off too quickly. I breathed hard and I passed a lot of people coming down near the first trail intersection. I jogged and hiked hard and just kept my head down trying to stay on my feet and pace.
#    
# **Charlie:** Amy had taken off and I waited for Odd and Sally to arrive.  I followed Odd after starting our watches together.  I wore a small pack, carried less than a liter of water and took along my hiking poles (I was more concerned about the descent than the climb due to an issue with my back).  Odd wore a small pack too.
#  
# I followed Odd, feeling very well the first mile and we flew up Brookside. Odd began to push the pace up Scar. I didn’t negotiate going over a large rock with a serrated edge and I cut my knee which wasn’t bad, but the scrape bled and looked more serious than it was. I was able to stay with him quite well until we reached the intersection with Airline. I told Odd to “Go for it” and he did! Odd disappeared and I kept working steadily.
#  
# **Amy:** When I popped out above treeline on Airline I looked at my watch and thought I am going to miss the time by just a few minutes, but I didn’t give up hope. I worked past the intersection of Chemin des Dames, soon I was above King Ravine and then running up Gulfside. I was happy I had not been passed by the men! 

# The sight of the cairn at Thunderstorm junction made me know that I was just a few tenths from the summit and I might just make it. I pushed harder and managed to jump from rock to rock to the top. I stopped my watch and since my eyesight isn’t so great it took me a moment to focus and see that I had made it with a whole minute and fifteen seconds to spare, 2:08:45!  I almost burst into tears of joy! Then, in just a few minutes, Odd was here with me and his watch read 1:39 something! Yeah. Soon Charlie arrived too!
#  
# **Charlie:** Amy and Odd were on top cheering for me! I felt good and tired. At the summit sign I had some difficulty turning off the goofy watch Amy had loaned me (I had forgot my own watch at home).  I had made it in 1:46-something, but I stopped my watch at 1:47:04!
#  
# Amy didn’t spend much time with us on the summit. She took off to visit the Perch Path and a few other trails in that area.  Odd and I waited for Sally and then the three of us descended to Madison Hut, where I enjoyed a slice of coffee cake and an apple juice.
#  
# Later the four of us celebrated and enjoyed supper at the SAalt Pub. The next morning Amy says to me, “I screwed up”. She went on to explain she had realized she didn’t go up Brookside but must have stayed on Valley Way and she didn’t want to believe it, but she was now sure. Our pillow talk just before sleep had triggered the realization that she taken a wrong turn.
#  
# **Amy:** I realized that I had somehow not gone straight up Brookside; I was so focused on time, that it had not occurred to me that I went off route.  Oh well, I may have not met the criteria of the challenge correctly but it was a good challenge and is my fastest time up Adams just the same.
#  
# Congratulations to Charlie for successfully meeting the challenge and to Odd for his faster time!
